Notes
* not all examinants are themselves paupers; though the majority are, some will be local officials and others examined concerning the circumstances of individual cases. 
* the examinations contain many more plebeian names - parents, children, siblings, employers, the alleged fathers of bastards, and so on.
* the dataset currently does not contain any text from the examinations or further information about their contents.

Fuller documentation to follow later...
